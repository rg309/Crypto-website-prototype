# Crypto-website-prototype
This is an unfinished website I created with the purpose of purchasing crypto. This is an HTML document with embedded CSS and JavaScript. The buttons are interactive and do function and is integrated with TradingView for live charts and pricing. Most of this was learned from watchin youtube videos and courses I have taken for fun.
